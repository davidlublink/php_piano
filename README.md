# php_piano
A piano, in PHP.


This project will use MCP23017 chips combined with a raspberry pi to scan an 88 key ( 178 button ) matrix keyboard and will pass the information to a synthesizer ( likely fluidsynth ) which will generate the sounds we want.


Goal : Replace main board in a Roland 230 piano with a raspberry pi and have it behave the same way.


Installation instructions : 

None yet, the scripts barely do anything right now. Check back later
